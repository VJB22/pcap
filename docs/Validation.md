\# üìä Cloud Engineer Validation Guide: Understanding the Dataset Columns

\#\# üìÇ What This Dataset Is

This dataset contains \*\*workload-level information\*\*, extracted from \*\*PCAP network traffic\*\*. Each \*\*row\*\* is a unique workload (an application, service, or machine), identified by MAC, IP, and port.  

The dataset maps \*\*network behavior to deployment artifacts\*\* (like containers, VMs, bare metal) based on observed communication patterns.

\#\# üß© Column-by-Column Explanation

| \*\*Column\*\* | \*\*Plain Language Meaning\*\* | \*\*Why It Matters\*\* |  
|------------|---------------------------|--------------------|  
| \`inferred\_artifact\_type\` | Our best guess for what kind of deployment it is | E.g., "baremetal", "vm", "container" |  
| \`artifact\_type\_ranked\` | Ranked list of likely deployment types | Shows other possibilities, like a top-3 |  
| \`artifact\_type\_top\_score\` | Score for the top-ranked guess (closer to 1 \= stronger match) | Confidence in the top guess |  
| \`artifact\_type\_entropy\` | How certain we are about the guess (lower \= better) | 0.2 \= high confidence, 1.0 \= uncertain |

\#\#\# Network Behavior Columns

| \*\*Column\*\* | \*\*Plain Language Meaning\*\* | \*\*Example/Interpretation\*\* |  
|------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|  
| \`degree\` | How many other workloads this one talks to | High \= core service; low \= edge workload |  
| \`flow\_count\` | Number of communication flows | High \= busy API or server; low \= passive client |  
| \`community\_size\` | Size of the cluster this workload belongs to (via Louvain detection) | Large \= microservices group; small \= isolated service |  
| \`burstiness\` | Is the workload‚Äôs traffic spiky (1) or stable (0)? | Bursty ‚Üí serverless; stable ‚Üí VM/baremetal |  
| \`session\_length\` | How long sessions last on average | Long \= stable VM/backend; short \= serverless/microservice |  
| \`peer\_count\` | Number of unique peers (destinations) the workload connects to | High \= API, load balancer; low \= isolated service |  
| \`data\_volume\` | Total bytes sent/received | High \= data-intensive workload (e.g., DB, analytics) |

\#\#\# Additional Context Columns

| \*\*Column\*\* | \*\*Plain Language Meaning\*\* | \*\*Example/Interpretation\*\* |  
|------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|  
| \`is\_virtual\_machine\` | Flag: Is this workload likely virtual? | Based on MAC OUI or IP reuse |  
| \`is\_data\_intensive\` | Flag: Sends/receives a lot of data | High-volume workloads (e.g., DB, file servers) |  
| \`is\_stable\_workload\` | Flag: Low volatility, long sessions | Backend, VM-like workloads |  
| \`is\_bursty\_dst\` | Flag: Destination has bursty traffic | Suggests serverless or event-driven pattern |  
| \`is\_compliance\_sensitive\` | Flag: Internal, stable, long sessions | Compliance-relevant workloads (e.g., databases) |

\#\# üèóÔ∏è What You‚Äôll See in the Data

Here‚Äôs a \*\*sample row\*\* to help you orient yourself:

| inferred\_artifact\_type | artifact\_type\_ranked | artifact\_type\_entropy | degree | flow\_count | community\_size | burstiness | session\_length | peer\_count | data\_volume |  
|------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|--------|------------|----------------|------------|----------------|------------|-------------|  
| vm                     | \["vm", "baremetal"\]  | 0.3                   | 10     | 150        | 8              | 0          | Long (seconds) | 5          | 1 GB        |  
| serverless             | \["serverless", "container"\] | 0.6             | 2      | 20         | 3              | 1          | Short (seconds) | 1          | 100 MB      |

\#\# üîç What I Need From You

‚úÖ Review if these \*\*artifact guesses\*\* make sense:    
\- Are high-degree, stable workloads really \*\*bare metal\*\* or \*\*VM\*\* in your world?    
\- Are bursty, short-session workloads realistically \*\*serverless\*\*?    
\- Do high-peer workloads match \*\*API gateways\*\* in practice?  

‚úÖ Spot any \*\*surprises or mismatches\*\*:    
\- Any workloads labeled \*\*container\*\* that seem more like \*\*VMs\*\*?    
\- Any missing patterns that you‚Äôd expect?  

‚úÖ \*\*Feedback on usability\*\*:    
\- Would this help your team with placement, security, optimization, or migration?
